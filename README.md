# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognizer using MLP
It is a simple machine learning-based project, developed by using one of the most popular machine learning algorithms "<b>Multi Layer Perceptron</b>".
<br> The 'Multi Layer Perceptron Model' in the project is trained by using very powerfull MNIST dataset having millions of hand written digit images.
<br> The project is developed in jupyter notebook under Anaconda environment.
<br> The model has accuracy of approx <b>96%</b>, which is good for few lines of code.
## Modules used:
* numpy
* torch
* torch.nn
* torchvision
* tqdm.notebook
